# UT-Austin
All Projects submitted under this repository are part of Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from University of Texas Austin which is going to end by March 2021.

Project 1 : MovieLens Project (Data Exploratory and Data Analysis)
 - Performed exploratory data analysis to explore the features and their importance. Also, explore trends in movie watching by the masses across the years.
 - Skills and Tools : Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA
 - Data set details and project overview is provided in MovieLens Project.ipynb file
 
Project 2 : Loans Campaign Target Prediction
 - Skills and Tools : Logistic Regression, Classification, Exploratory Data Analysis
   
 - Project: Problem Statement - Personal Loan Campaign Modelling
 - Thera Bank Personal Loan Campaign
 
Data Description:
- The dataset contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage,securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
 
Domain: Banking
 
Context:
 - This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

- Personal Loan: Did this customer accept the personal loan offered in the last campaign?
- Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?
- CD Account: Does the customer have a certificate of deposit (CD) account with the bank?
- Online: Does the customer use internet banking facilities?
- Credit card: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the bank?

Project 3 : Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
Goal: 
Using the data collected from existing customers, build a model that will help the marketing team identify potential customers who are relatively more likely to subscribe term deposit and thus increase their hit ratio.

-	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to help an anonymized marketing company identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to term deposit.
-	Implemented different combinations of hyperparameters across simple linear models, decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosted models.
